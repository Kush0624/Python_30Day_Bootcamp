# Write a program to import the random module and print 5 random integers between 1 and 100.

# Write a program that:

# Creates a file notes.txt

# Writes 3 lines into it

# Reads the file and prints its content.

# Write a program that handles exceptions when converting user input into an integer.

# Write a program that tries to open a file that doesnâ€™t exist and handles the error gracefully.

# Create your own module mymath.py with functions add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Import it in another Python file and use the functions.
